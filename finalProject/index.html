        The North Carolina Tar Heels Men's basketball program is the intercollegiate basketball team of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
        The Tar Heels have won seven men's basketball national championships (1924, 1957, 1982, 1993, 2005, 2009, and 2017). 
        North Carolina's six NCAA Tournament Championships are third-most all-time, behind UCLA and Kentucky. 
        UNC has also won 18 Atlantic Coast Conference tournament titles,[2] 32 Atlantic Coast Conference regular season titles,[3] and an Atlantic Coast Conference record 21 outright regular season championships.
        The program has produced many notable players who went on to play in the NBA, including four of ESPN's top 74 players of all-time: Michael Jordan, James Worthy, Vince Carter, and Bob McAdoo (tied for most with UCLA and Georgetown).
        Many Tar Heel assistant coaches and players have gone on to become head coaches elsewhere.
        From the Tar Heels' first season in 1910â€“11 through the 2020-21 season, the program has amassed a .734 all-time winning percentage (second highest all-time), winning 2,293 games and losing 829 games in 111 seasons.
